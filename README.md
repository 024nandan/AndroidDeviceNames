A small Android library to get the market name of an Android device.

On many popular devices the market name of the device is not available. For example, on the Samsung Galaxy S6 the value of [`Build.MODEL`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html#MODEL) could be `"SM-G920F"`, `"SM-G920I"`, or `"SM-G920W8"`.

This small library gets the market (consumer friendly) name of a device.

Usage
-----

**Get the name of the current device:**

```java
String deviceName = DeviceName.getDeviceName();
```

The above code will get the correct device name for the top 600 Android devices. If the device is unrecognized, then [`Build.MODEL`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html#MODEL) is returned. This can be executed from the UI thread.

**Get the name of a device using the device's codename:**

```java
// Retruns "Moto X Style"
DeviceName.getDeviceName("clark", "Unknown device");
```

**Get information about the device:**

```java
DeviceName.with(context).request(new DeviceName.Callback() {

  @Override public void onFinished(DeviceName.DeviceInfo info, Exception error) {
    String manufacturer = info.manufacturer;  // "Samsung"
    String name = info.marketName;            // "Galaxy S6 Edge"
    String model = info.model;                // "SM-G925I"
    String codename = info.codename;          // "zerolte"
    String deviceName = info.getName();       // "Galaxy S6 Edge"
    // FYI: We are on the UI thread.
  }
});
 ```

The above code loads [JSON from a generated list](https://github.com/jaredrummler/AndroidDeviceNames/tree/master/json) of device names based on [Google's maintained list](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1727131?hl=en). It will be up-to-date with Google's supported device list so that you will get the correct name for new or unknown devices. This supports *over 10,000* devices.

This will only make a network call once. The value is saved to SharedPreferences for future calls.

Download
--------

Download [the latest AAR](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/jaredrummler/android-device-names/1.0.3/android-device-names-1.0.3.aar) or grab via Gradle:

```groovy
compile 'com.jaredrummler:android-device-names:1.0.3'
```

Or simply copy the [DeviceName](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaredrummler/AndroidDeviceNames/master/library/src/main/java/com/jaredrummler/android/device/DeviceName.java) class intro your project, update the package declaration, and you are good to go.

How does it work?
-----------------

When Google releases an update to [their list](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1727131?hl=en) of supported devices on Google Play, their PDF is converted to an excel document using [nitro](https://www.gonitro.com/). The excel document is then parsed and converted into thousands of JSON files [here](json). A Java method is then autogenerated for the most popular 600+ devices.
